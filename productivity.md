## Productivity, Goal Setting, and Time Management

Developing time management and projet management skills are an important part of your scientific training. This includes productivity techniques (knowing your own body clock, breaking down large tasks into smaller chunks), as well as setting personal and professional goals (both short- and long-term). 

All lab members are expected to complete and maintain a yearly "Individual Development Plan". In addition, we will ocassionally carry out additional skill building exercises and discussions as part of our weekly lab meetings.
