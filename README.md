### Welcome to the [Bik Lab](https://biklab.github.io/) at [UC Riverside](http://www.ucr.edu/)!

This github repo is a compilation of valuable resources with which new lab members should familiarize themselves. 

Before you delve into science and other important things, please look over the following recommendations.

1. **The internet is your best friend but it can be mean to you every now and then**
	* Most (bio)informaticy questions you'll have can be answered online. Always search the web first but if your best friend isn't being kind and helpful, then ask a human being.

2. **Save your commands!**
	* After you become an expert command line user, don't become complacent. Always save the commands you ran for the day and/or a quick summary of what you did. We recommend using [GitHub](https://github.com/) for saving commands and an online tool like [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) for keeping track of daily accomplishments.
	
3. **Download a nice text editor**
	* NEVER edit your commands in Word. Download a text editor where you can type, edit, comment, etc. your commands. We like [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/).
