### Welcome to the [Bik Lab](https://www.biklab.org) at UGA!

**Lab Mission Statement**: 

1. To perform cutting-edge research at the interface of biological and computational sciences; being leaders in the field of ecological and evolutionary -Omics approaches focused on microbial eukaryotes in marine sediments (with an emphasis on free-living nematodes and deep-sea habitats). 
2. To ensure that all lab members become well-rounded scientists with sufficient training and expertise that will allow them to succeed in their chosen career path. This will be accomplished by professional development that focuses on: effective written, verbal  and visual communication skills; bioinformatics and programming skills; experience in project managment; scientific outreach and education; fostering relationships with policymakers and stakeholders.

**Core Values**: Exploring innovative and cross-discipinary science, creativity, teamwork, research excellence, practicing open science, communicating our technical knowledge and scientific results to non-scientists


This github repo is a compilation of valuable resources for new Bik lab members. Our lab utilizes ***-omics*** and computational biology approaches to study the microbial eukaryote biodiversity and evolution in marine environments and other ecosystems. 

Below is a short list of tutorials we recommend you review to get comfortable with nagivating the Linux environment. 

1. **Introduction to (meta)genomics and more**
	* Our lab utilized the ***-omics*** approch to study the meiofaunal biodiversity that exists in marine environments and other ecosystems. We highly recommend watching a series of tutorial  

2. **Save your commands!**
	* After you become an expert command line user, don't become complacent. Always save the commands you ran for the day and/or a quick summary of what you did. We recommend using [GitHub](https://github.com/) for saving commands and an online tool like [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) for keeping track of daily accomplishments.
	
3. **Download a nice text editor**
	* NEVER edit your commands in Word. Download a text editor where you can type, edit, comment, etc. your commands. We like [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/).
