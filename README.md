### Welcome to the [Bik Lab](https://biklab.github.io/) at [UC Riverside](http://www.ucr.edu/)!

This github repo is a compilation of valuable resources for new Bik lab members.
Below is an overview of the types of resources posted in the repo.

1. **Introduction to (meta)genomics and more**
	* Our lab utilized the ***-omics*** approch to study the meiofaunal biodiversity that exists in marine environments and other ecosystems. We highly recommend watching a series of tutorial  

2. **Save your commands!**
	* After you become an expert command line user, don't become complacent. Always save the commands you ran for the day and/or a quick summary of what you did. We recommend using [GitHub](https://github.com/) for saving commands and an online tool like [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) for keeping track of daily accomplishments.
	
3. **Download a nice text editor**
	* NEVER edit your commands in Word. Download a text editor where you can type, edit, comment, etc. your commands. We like [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/).
