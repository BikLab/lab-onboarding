##Grants and Funding

**Here are a few resources at UCR that new faculty may wish to explore:**

* Identifying Funding Opportunities. We use [COS Pivot](http://pivot.cos.com), a service that collects grant opportunities from the federal government.  If you have a UCR email address, you can create an account on Pivot.   It is easy to do, but if you like instruction, [they are available at here](http://research.ucr.edu/ord/funding/search-engines/pivot.aspx). In addition to searching for funding opportunities, Pivot allows one to save a search and emails you with new opportunities.

* [Electronic Campus Approval Form:](http://cnc.ucr.edu/ecaf/quick_start.html) UCR submits over 1500 proposals a year and has a streamlines electronic approval process for proposal submission.

* [Cayuse:](http://research.ucr.edu/spa/electronic-research-administration/cayuse.aspx) Cayuse is an electric system that facilitates creations, submission and collaboration on proposals.  UCR uses it for all federal proposals that are
submitted through grants.gov, including NIH proposals.   While Cayuse and
grants.gov can submit NSF proposals, nearly all NSF proposals are submitted
through Fastlane.


**Research Integrity:**

* [Institutional
review boards (IRBs)](https://research.ucr.edu/ori/committees/irb.aspx) - UCR has two IRBs. A social-behavioral IRB and a
clinical IRB.   The IRBs are required by federal regulations to review all
human subjects research conducted on behalf of the institution.  IRB review
is required for both funded and non-funded human subject research.

* [Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)](https://research.ucr.edu/ori/committees/iacuc.aspx) which oversees all
research and care involving vertebrate animals.

* [Institutional
Biosafety Committee (IBC)](https://research.ucr.edu/ori/committees/ibc.aspx) functions as the local review body responsible for
oversight of research activities, including teaching laboratories, involving
the use, storage and handling of biohazardous materials

* [Promoting
Research Objectivity (PRO)](https://research.ucr.edu/ori/committees/coic.aspx) is charged with reviewing investigator statements
of financial interest related to their sponsored research activities and
determining whether a conflict of interest management plan is warranted
after review of all the facts and circumstances.

* [Stem Cell
Research Oversight (SCRO) Committee](https://research.ucr.edu/ori/committees/scro.aspx) reviews activities involving human stem
cell research, regardless of the type of stem cells or whether the stem
cells are adult or embryonic.

* Forms to have protocols/research approved by these committees may be found
at [https://research.ucr.edu/about/forms/research-integrity-forms.aspx](https://research.ucr.edu/about/forms/research-integrity-forms.aspx)

**Technology Commercialization**

* The Office of Technology Partnerships assists faculty and students with
patenting inventions, licensing technology and forming companies.   See

and details.
